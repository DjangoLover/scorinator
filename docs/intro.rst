Scorinator is an open source project used to score open source projects.  Scoring
is based on general open source best practice.  Various attributes which are
scored include:

  * Is the project on github/bitbucket?
  * How many forks? stars? commits? contributors?
  * Does it include a README file?
  * Does it have a LICENSE file?
  * Does it have CI for unit tests?
  * What is the code coverage percentage?
  * Are docs available on ReadTheDocs?
  * Is it in PyPi? How many downloads? When was it last updated?
  * Does it have a setup.py file? Are the classifiers relevant?

This list isn't fully inclusive of all the things that could be used to score a
project. If there's additional attributes that you don't see listed, feel free
to open an issue mentioning an attribute (or submit a PR with the enhancement!).
